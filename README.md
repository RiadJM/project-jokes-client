API repository corresponding to this client: https://github.com/RiadJM/Jokes

Deployed Jokes API on heroku: https://fathomless-castle-77616.herokuapp.com

Deployed Jokes Client:

Technologies Used: HTML5, javascript, css, bootstrap, jquery, ajax.

The goal was to create an app that has all the user authentications needed, and allowed the user to login and be able to create a new resource and be able to edit it, delete it or show all resources.

The project was started by developing the backend and making sure that the user model and routes were set up correctly. Then the next step was to develop the joke model and its respective routes. The API response was tested with curl scripts for all CRUD actions after that.
The next step was to develop the user authentication for the front end, and make sure that the requests are being sent and received correctly, and that the responses were being sent and received properly as well.
After that, the focus was on being able to render the information being sent back from the API to the user's screen.
Finally the goal was to make sure that all authenticated actions were only visible and available to authenticated users.

Some unsolved problems for future iterations include:
- adding the ability for the user to comment on a joke.
- more styling to make the app look more appealing and pleasing to the eye.
- adding the ability for the user to be able to look up a specific joke.
- hide the change password forms and button only to be visible when the user needs them.


User stories:

user should be able to sign up!
user should then be able to sign in!

user should be able to edit their own joke
